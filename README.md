Truck drivers are at fault in 90% of two-vehicle crashes
involving trucks, according to a report published by Volvo
in 2017 by its accident research team.Over 4000 people lose their life to such heavy vehicle
related accidents. If we were able to assist the driver, we
could save about 3600 people. Most of the Blindspot region is
concentrated to the left side of the
truck relative to direction of motion
for a right hand drive truck.

Our aim to create a Driver Assistance System, particularly
for Heavy Vehicles using an array of Positional Sensors
around the trailer to perceive and track objects in the blind-
spots and relay this information to the driver through the
means of haptic feedback
The system will help to augment the driver’s perception of
his surroundings, providing additional redundancy in case
the driver loses awareness of a part of their vehicle’s
surroundings.
Feedback will only be provided when the driver may
potentially be colliding with an obstacle, such as when
there’s a car and the driver tries to turn

### RADARS
Radars are used to map the whole 2D
or 3D scenes in their range for
obstacle detection, which is usually a
Frustum. They rely on the phase shift
of received radio waves to identify
moving obstacles.

### Simulation test bed and proof of concept
We are running simulation for the truck in
Webots Simulator, wherein we simulate the
actual highway conditions with the sensors
and collect their data
